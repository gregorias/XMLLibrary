In this project I have used the following technologies:

JAXB - for GUI's data model
XSLT - to generate xml reports and html pages in REST interface
XPATH - used inside XSLT

JavaFX - Java's new GUI library. Very convenient, especially the properties and
binding stuff, which brings Java closer to functional reactive programming.

Java's 8 new features such as:
  Lambda functions - Turns out you can use them when a class with only one
    method (or just one abstract method) is expected. Very handy!
  Streams - They use functional programming for processing data. Also very
    handy.
